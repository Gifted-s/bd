In Rust, the std::fs module provides the File type, which can be used to perform file operations. To implement file punch hole in Rust, you can use the libc crate for the low-level system calls. The fallocate system call with the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag is commonly used for punching holes in a file.

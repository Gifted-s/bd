Write algorithm

  - Get the size of the sstable

  - Get which bucket will be the best to store the sstable by using the bucket average size

      - If bucket exist, then write sstable to its directory and return bucket url

      - Else, create new bucket, write sstable to its directory, append to list of buckets and return sstable file path

  - Append the sstable file path to bloom filter and append bloom filter to existing bloom filters

  - Clear MemTable
